Since I got my Asus eee I've been continually swapping distros, since
the preinstalled Xandros wasn't cutting it. Until now I've had Ubuntu,
Ubuntu-eee, eeebuntu, Mandriva, Debian... and the list could go on.

Nothing to say, all great, stable & clean distros. And then came
`crunchbang <http://crunchbanglinux.org/>`__, with it's spinoff
`cruncheee <http://crunchbanglinux.org/forums/topic/424/cruncheee-81001-release-candidate-1/>`__.

The install iso is smaller than 500 megs, so it really lost some fat
compared to the other distros. The installation is quick and painless,
thanks to Ubiquity (Ubuntu's installer, since crunchbang is a derivative
of Ubuntu).

After you install you get a lean and mean sistem, with a minimal suite
of apps. Personally I don't like to use a standalone mail client, a
clipboard manager and some other applets, so Clawsmail, Parcellite and
some other stuff was out.
Also, I replaced the NetworkManager applet with
`Wicd <http://wicd.sourceforge.net/>`__.

Still, after adding some stuff to the tray, like the software keyboard
leds, it still used 128 megs of ram, which is great.

The keyboard shortcuts are absolutely great, and the list in conky makes
for a steep learning curve.

I also updated all the apps, added the build-essential package, abiword
for minimal text editing, gimp for photo editing and FBReader for
e-books and the install size is about 1.3Gb.

So, if you fancy my office-oriented crunchbag/cruncheee remix (well, at
least for the time dropbox will put up with me), get it here:

`cruncheee-8.10.01.i386fmbuild.iso <https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/389421/cruncheee-8.10.01.i386fmbuild.iso>`__

`cruncheee-8.10.01.i386fmbuild.iso.md5 <https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/389421/cruncheee-8.10.01.i386fmbuild.iso.md5>`__
