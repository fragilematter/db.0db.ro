Yesterday `LO 192 <http://linuxoutlaws.com/podcast/192>`__ was released
and in it Dan & Fab pimped a recently released audiobook, "Blue Heaven",
written and read by
`lostnbronx <http://www.info-underground.net:70/lostnbronx/>`__. Since
I'm a sucker for audiobooks I grabbed it right away, and since I found
it most excellent I thought I'd blabber a bit about it right here.

From a dramatic point of view, it really is, well, dramatic. I'll try
to keep this spoiler-free, so I'm just going to say that the
psychology of the (main?!) character is deeply connected to the
action, and the two swap in and out of focus, in a very neatly
orchestrated manner. Since I mentioned the action, it takes place in
Skyhigh, a space colony/space station city inhabited by Earth's
outcasts. Although this place does share a few characteristics with
the typical sci-fi counterpart, the resemblance stops there.

I won't go into detail about the action because I want you to discover
it yourselves, so I'm gonna cheat and skip to the end. While I
anticipated the finale, the action that leads to it surpassed any of
my expectations. It suffices to say that there is a climax there, and
it will surprise you.

On the technical side, somewhere in the ogg file's tags it says:
"[...] these four pieces, rather ineptly cut together by lostnbronx
[...]." It's anything but ineptly, lostnbronx did an amazing job with
the audio backgrounds, and it's obvious all-around that this was a
work of passion. There is a bit of unevenness in the audio levels or
tonality near the beginning, maybe a switch of recording equipment,
but other than that I think that overall the recording easily rivals
Audible productions.

The reading/acting is very well carried out, and IMHO lostnbronx has a
really cool voice.

That's about it, head on over to lostnbronx's webpage for Blue Heaven at
