Here's a minimally modded monsterpack for the Motorola MotoRIZR Z8 based
on ESPOO_U_46.05.40I - build 2393:

http://www.mediafire.com/?bsel22hhtj82b30.


**Modifications consist of:**

-  patched *installserver.exe* that doesn't check application
   certificates (taken from Elegance V2.0 iRzr)
-  disabled d_exc debugging at boot (by replacing
   *SSCForStartupMode0.RSC* and *SSCForStartupMode1.RSC* in
   *private\10205c44\\* with the respective files from
   ESPOO_U_46.04.84G)

That's about it, no funky themes, icons, DRM or whatnot... Enjoy!
