I'm a fan of the KOSS Porta Pro headphones. They are reasonably cheap,
they sound very good and they're reasonably comfy. Best of all, you'll
look like you came back from the future while you wear them.

The only issue I have with them is that finding replacement earpads 
can be quite difficult or expensive around some parts of Eastern Europe.

I was looking at the dimensions of various replacement earpads from 
different brands and I took a gamble ordering a pair of Sennheiser
HZP 09 foams and whaddya know, they fit perfectly!

I couldn't find this documented anywhere on the web, so I thought I'd
throw this up here.
